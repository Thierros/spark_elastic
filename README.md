# Project overview
This project focuses on building a scalable data pipeline using Apache Spark for transformation and Elasticsearch for indexing and searching.

# Why Spark and Elasticsearch?
**Apache Spark**: Provides distributed computing for high-speed data transformation.
**Elasticsearch**: Enables fast search and analytics over large datasets.
**Scalability**: Both technologies scale horizontally, making them ideal for large-scale applications.

## The project architecture consists of the following key components:
- **Apache Spark**: A powerful distributed framework for large-scale data processing.
- **Elasticsearch**: A distributed search and analytics engine optimized for real-time data retrieval.
- **Kibana**: A data visualization tool tightly integrated with Elasticsearch for interactive dashboards and analytics.
